# Movie reviews

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the steps taken to develop a machine learning model for classifying film reviews. The analysis focuses on the Andrew Maas's Large Movie Review Dataset, which consists of 50,000 labeled film reviews as either positive or negative.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify film reviews as positive or negative. The work is divided into several stages, as outlined below:

1. Preprocessing Phase:
   - Creation of a vocabulary: All words in the dataset are extracted to form a vocabulary.
   - Bag-of-Words (BOW) approach: The number of occurrences of each word in each review is counted, creating a BOW representation.

2. Model Training:
   - Different models are created and compared using various preprocessing techniques.
   - Preprocessing techniques include stemming and the removal of common and meaningless words from the vocabulary.
   - The BOW representation is used to train the models.

3. Model Evaluation:
   - The trained models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics.
   - Different classifiers, such as logistic regression and multinomial Naive Bayes, are used and their performance is compared.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study is Andrew Maas's Large Movie Review Dataset. It consists of 50,000 film reviews labeled as positive or negative. The dataset provides a reliable foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning models.
